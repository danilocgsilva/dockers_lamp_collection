# Dockers lamp Collection

**Written in 2021-05-22**

Repository for Dockers receipts designed for LAMP environment.

*This is not a software projec/code*.

As a web developer trying to get the most from Docker, I've notice that are several ways inside Docker do provides a lamp environment.

Lots of things that is already seted, that is setted on different places, sometimes that comes ready but hidden for editting or that does not exposes obvius ways to tweaks can be found in different dockers receipts.

This is good and bad. Good because provides so much convinience and things ready to go. Bad, beacause it pushes the users to *ignorance*, as everything is so ready, that removes the programmer need to understand what is going behind. So the things may work, but the professional does not knows whats is going on or every steps that leds the environment to work. Ok if you have a simple hello world application. But for serious applications, may having the environment *just working* may not be enough, or even serious for a good prefessional.

We have two alternatives: dominates the old fashion to manage lamp environment (which by far is something very usefull and required for the most advanced situations), or dominates and gives flexibility for dockers environments.

THIS PROJECT GOES TO THE SECOND HAND: lets document Dockers environments put some analysis.

## Dockers receipts found:

* [Docker IO site - docker receipts generator](dockers_collections_texts/docker-generator.md)
